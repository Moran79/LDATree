## Resubmission (08/25/2023)

Sorry for the inconvenience!

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* increment the version number from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2

* Fixed one HTML plot in the vignette due to a CRAN check error for flavor r-release-macos-x86_64. The error message is *Pandoc is required to build R Markdown vignettes but not available. Please make sure it is installed.*
