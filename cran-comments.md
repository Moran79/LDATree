## Resubmission (08/21/2023)

Thank you for pointing out those problems. Many of these I may never notice.

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed all `cat` to verbose style.

* Changed the `<<-` to `<-`

* Successfully remove the archivedFuns.R from the bundle. Used the wrong syntax in the .Rbuildignore file the first time.

About the reference: Sorry, since this method has not been published, I do not have any direct reference to add. Maybe I can do so in future submissions.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
