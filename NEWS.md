# LDATree 0.1.2

* Fixed one HTML plot in the vignette due to a CRAN check error for flavor r-release-macos-x86_64. The error message is *Pandoc is required to build R Markdown vignettes but not available. Please make sure it is installed.*

# LDATree 0.1.1

* Fixed two examples in functions due to an MKL error from Additional issues. It detects an out-of-bounds error in one of the plots in the example.

# LDATree 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
