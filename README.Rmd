`LDATree` is an R modeling package for fitting classification trees. If you are unfamiliar with classification trees, here is a [tutorial](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/35-statistical-machine-learning-essentials/141-cart-model-decision-tree-essentials/) about the traditional CART and its R implementation `rpart`.

## Overview

Compared to other similar trees, `LDATree` sets itself apart in the following ways:

* It applies the idea of LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) when selecting variables, finding splits, and fitting models in terminal nodes.

* It addresses certain limitations of the R implementation of LDA (`MASS::lda`), such as handling missing values, dealing with more features than samples, and constant values within groups.

* Re-implement LDA using the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), LDATree offers quick response, particularly with large datasets.

* The package also includes several visualization tools to provide deeper insights into the data.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("LDATree") # This version is an outdated one from 08/2023.

# As of 06/2024, please use the command below for the current version,
# the official CRAN release will be coming soon!

# library(devtools)
# install_github('Moran79/LDATree')
```

## Usage

To build an LDATree:

```{r,fig.asp=0.618,out.width = "100%",fig.align = "center"}
library(LDATree)
set.seed(443)
mpg <- as.data.frame(ggplot2::mpg)
datX <- mpg[, -5] # All predictors without Y
response <- mpg[, 5] # we try to predict "cyl" (number of cylinders)
fit <- Treee(datX = datX, response = response, verbose = FALSE)
```

To plot the LDATree:

```{r,fig.asp=0.618,out.width = "80%",fig.align = "center", eval=FALSE}
# View the overall tree.
plot(fit)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot1-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

```{r plot2,fig.asp=0.618,out.width = "80%",fig.align = "center", echo=TRUE}
# Three types of individual plots
# 1. Scatter plot on first two LD scores
plot(fit, datX = datX, response = response, node = 1)

# 2. Density plot on the first LD score
plot(fit, datX = datX, response = response, node = 3)

# 3. A message
plot(fit, datX = datX, response = response, node = 2)
```

To make predictions:

```{r,fig.asp=0.618,out.width = "100%",fig.align = "center", echo=TRUE}
# Prediction only.
predictions <- predict(fit, datX)
head(predictions)
```

```{r,fig.asp=0.618,out.width = "100%",fig.align = "center", echo=TRUE}
# A more informative prediction
predictions <- predict(fit, datX, type = "all")
head(predictions)
```
